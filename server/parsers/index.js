MAV_SEVERITY
0	MAV_SEVERITY_EMERGENCY	System is unusable. This is a "panic" condition.
1	MAV_SEVERITY_ALERT	Action should be taken immediately. Indicates error in non-critical systems.
2	MAV_SEVERITY_CRITICAL	Action must be taken immediately. Indicates failure in a primary system.
3	MAV_SEVERITY_ERROR	Indicates an error in secondary/redundant systems.
4	MAV_SEVERITY_WARNING	Indicates about a possible future error if this is not resolved within a given timeframe. Example would be a low battery warning.
5	MAV_SEVERITY_NOTICE	An unusual event has occurred, though not an error condition. This should be investigated for the root cause.
6	MAV_SEVERITY_INFO	Normal operational messages. Useful for logging. No action is required for these messages.
7	MAV_SEVERITY_DEBUG	Useful non-operational messages that can assist in debugging. These should not occur during normal operation.
